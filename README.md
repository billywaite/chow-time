# Chow Time

## Working on an app for my own personal use during cooking. At the moment, I want to accomplish the following:
1. Create a webapp using node to search for recipes, data will come from Yummly's API.
2. Create a grocery list based on your selected recipes using react.
3. Store favorite recipes in your user profile.

## To do:
1. Display json data from the yummly api
2. Set up database files to make initial queries

## Ideas:
1. Instead of using the Yummly api, make this a collaboration tool where people can add recipes from other websites and type up recipes?
